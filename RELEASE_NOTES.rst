  to allow for the management of all stored scripts including the ability to define entirely new scripts.
- Added new event listener system. The event listener systems allows any class/function to be registered as an event
  listener. The event listener receives incoming events from the telemetry system on a redis pub/sub channel. These
  events are then processed by custom code automatically.
