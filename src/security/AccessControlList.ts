/**
 * The access control list provides a generic interface for the storage of user and roles permissions. Each ACL object
 * represents the permission set for a single entity within the system. The entity is identified generically by its
 * universally unique identifier (`uuid`). Each entry in the ACL records the permissions available to a particular user
 * or role.
 *
 * Each permission can be one of the following actions:
 * - `Create` - The user or role can create a new record or object.
 * - `Read` - The user or role can read the record or object.
 * - `Update` - The user or role can modify existing records or objects.
 * - `Delete` - The user or role can delete existing records or objects.
 * - `Special` - The user or role has special prilieges to edit the ACL permissions.
 * - `Full` - The user or role has total control over the record or object and supersedes any of the above.
 *
 * For each of the above actions the user or role will be granted either an `allow` permission or a `deny` permission.
 * If an `allow` is granted, the user or role has permission to perform that action. If a `deny` is set, then the user
 * or role is denied that action. If no explicit `allow` or `deny` is set then the user or role will inherit the
 * permission from a parent role or ACL.
 *
 * ACLs can be chained via single inheritance through the specification of the `parentUid`. This allows the ability to
 * create complex trees of permissions that can easily inherit control schemes to make the definition of permissions
 * easier.
